# ðŸŽ¾ Tennis with Friends
## Motivation
Tennis with Friends is an idea I've had since high school but I never had the motivation or technical abilities to actually make anything remotely close. So during winter break, I spent around 3 weeks teaching myself React.js for the frontend & Firebase for backend storage. 

## Work Done
I was able to create multiple user sign ups and implement user authentication using Firebase for security. I also designed my own custom components in Figma and re-implemented them in React. 

## Future work 
Overall, I need to spend some more time making the website dynamic for each user.
